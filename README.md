# CSE-309-Contact-Us-page
A "contact us" page made using HTML, bootstrap and PHP. Backend is handled using XAMPP

This won't work by simply downloading and opening the index.html as it was done using XAMPP 

To work it -> 
1) download xampp app from https://www.apachefriends.org, install and open
2) start apache and mySQL, and go to mySQL admin, that will be the place for you database handling
3) make a database and tables as you wish.
4) make sure the database, table and table-column names match the ones in the .php files.
5) download the repository zip, extract to a folder ("folderName") and move folder inside 'htdocs' folder.
6) htdocs can be found inside xampp, open xampp control panel and go to explorer, there you will find htdocs folder.
7) go to your browser, type 'localhost/"folderName"/index.html' for the landing page, or 'localhost/"folderName"/contactlist.php' to see the database as an HTML table.
